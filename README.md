Please add user-stories by adding an 'issue' (see above) and tagging it 'user-story'. User stories should start with a sentence of the form:

> As an [ACTOR], I would like to [DO SOMETHING] in order to achieve [SOME BENEFIT].
[see example](https://github.com/dcmi/pids_in_dc/issues/1)

You may also add a question, or a suggested solution, or some other issue by raising a Github issue (see above) and tagging it approriately.

# PIDS in Dublin Core

This initiative seeks to develop a DCMI recommendation on how to express Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) in XML-based metadata application profiles which use properties from [DCMI Metadata Terms](http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/).

This recommendation should have wide applicability. It is required in particular by several organisations working in the general domain of scholarly communications, and with open-access repository systems in particular. This work will, therefore, benefit from the focus provided by some closely related 'real world' user-stories.

This project will:

1. Solicit 'real-world' user-stories and use-cases from interested parties, using the ['issues' feature in this repository](https://github.com/dcmi/pids_in_dc/issues).
2. Develop some [candidate approaches](/proposal/The_Association_of_Persistent_Identifiers_with_Literals_in_XML-formatted_Metadata_using_Dublin.md) to expressing PIDs in metadata using properties from the Dublin Core vocabularies in the context of the examples described in #1.
3. Hold a special session at the [DCMI annual conference in Porto, Portugal in September 2018](http://www.dublincore.org/conference/2018/), where the issue will be discussed with the intention of agreeing a consensus.
4. Publish the results as a DCMI Recommendation.
5. Develop algorithms/tools for converting metadata based on the XML schema into RDF for the purposes of publication as Linked Data.
