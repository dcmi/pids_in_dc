Please add user-stories by adding an 'issue' (see above) and tagging it 'user-story'. User stories should start with a sentence of the form:

> As an [ACTOR], I would like to [DO SOMETHING] in order to achieve [SOME BENEFIT].
[see example](https://github.com/dcmi/pids_in_dc/issues/1)

You may also add a questions, or a suggested solution, by raising an issue (see above) and tagging it approriately.

# PIDS in Dublin Core

This initiative seeks to develop a DCMI recommendation on how to express Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) in XML-based metadata application profiles which use properties from the [Dublin Core Metadata Element Set](http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dces/) (DCES).

This recommendation should have wide applicability. It is required in particular by several organisations working in the general domain of scholarly communications, and with open-access repository systems in particular. This work will, therefore, benefit from the focus provided by some closely related 'real world' user-stories.

This project will:

1. Solicit 'real-world' user-stories and use-cases from interested parties, using the 'issues' feature in this repository.
2. Develop some candidate approaches to expressing PIDs in metadata using properties from the DCES in the context of the examples described in #1.
3. Hold a special session at the [DCMI annual conference in Porto, Portugal in September 2018](http://www.dublincore.org/conference/2018/), where the candidate approaches will be discussed with the intention of agreeing a consensus.
4. Publish the results, either as a DCMI Recommendation or as a revision of the DCES itself.
5. Develop an RDF-based application profile and algorithm for converting metadata based on the XML schema into RDF for the purposes of publication as Linked Data.
