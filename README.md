# PIDS in Dublin Core

This project seeks to develop a DCMI recomndation on how to express Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) in Dublin Core metadata. *Dublin Core metadata* is used here to mean metadata, typically formed in *records*, which uses either the [DCMI Metadata Terms](http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/) or the [Dublin Core Metadata Element Set](http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dces/).

The recommendation has been requested by several organisations working the area of scholarly communications metadata - especially with open-access repositories.

This project will:

1. Solicit 'real-world' user-stories and use-cases from interested parties, using the 'issues' feature in this repository
2. Develop some candidate approaches to expressing PIDs in metadata in the context of the examples described in #1
3. Develop a workshop or similar session to take place during the [DCMI annual conference in Porto, Portugal in September 2018](http://www.dublincore.org/conference/2018/), where the candidate approaches will be discussed with the intention of agreeing a consensus
4. Develop this recommendation into an published DCMI Recommendation.
